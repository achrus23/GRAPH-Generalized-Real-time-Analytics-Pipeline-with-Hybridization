# Phase 1: Foundational Graph Processing  

🚀 **Phase 1 focuses on setting up a containerized Neo4j environment** to process and analyze the NYC Yellow Cab trip dataset as a graph. This phase includes:  
- **Dockerized deployment** of Neo4j for modular and scalable graph storage.  
- **Graph modeling** of pickup/drop-off locations & trip relationships.  
- **Implementation of core graph algorithms**:  
  - **PageRank** to identify influential locations.  
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to compute shortest paths.
